What is the cloud?
------------------

.. note::

   A computing cloud is a virtualized environment that provides on-demand computing resources such as servers, storage, and applications over the Internet. Cloud computing allows users to access and use these resources without having to own or manage the underlying physical infrastructure.

Cloud computing typically involves a third-party provider, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP), which owns and operates the underlying infrastructure, and provides various services to customers on a pay-as-you-go or subscription basis.

There are three main types of cloud computing:

#. **Public cloud**: computing resources are shared by multiple organizations and are accessible over the public internet.
#. **Private cloud**: computing resources are dedicated to a single organization and are typically hosted on-premises or in a private data center.
#. **Hybrid cloud**: a combination of public and private clouds that are integrated and share data and applications.

Cloud computing offers many benefits, including scalability, flexibility, cost savings, and ease of use. It has become an essential technology for many businesses and organizations, enabling them to innovate, compete, and operate more efficiently.

On-premises vs Cloud
--------------------

.. note::

   On-premises computing refers to the use of computing resources that are owned and managed by an organization. These resources are typically located on the organization's premises, but they can also be hosted in a private data center.
