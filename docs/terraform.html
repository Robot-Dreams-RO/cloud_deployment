<h1>3. Infrastructure as a Code<a class="headerlink" href="#infrastructure-as-a-code" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h1>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Infrastructure as code (IaC) is an approach to managing IT infrastructure in which infrastructure resources are provisioned and managed using code and software development techniques. The idea behind IaC is to treat infrastructure like software, meaning that it can be version controlled, tested, and deployed in a consistent and repeatable manner.</p>
</div>
<p>With IaC, infrastructure resources such as servers, networking, and storage are defined and managed using code, which can be stored in version control systems like Git. This code can then be used to automate the provisioning and management of infrastructure resources, making it easier to maintain consistency, track changes, and quickly deploy and scale resources as needed.</p>
<p>Some benefits of using IaC include:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Increased automation: IaC allows for automated deployment and management of infrastructure resources, reducing the need for manual intervention and improving consistency and reliability.</p></li>
<li><p>Improved scalability: With IaC, infrastructure resources can be easily scaled up or down as needed, making it easier to meet changing business requirements and accommodate growth.</p></li>
<li><p>Enhanced security: IaC allows for more consistent and standardized security practices, making it easier to identify and remediate security issues.</p></li>
<li><p>Better collaboration: IaC allows for teams to work more collaboratively since infrastructure resources can be managed using code that can be shared, version controlled, and tested.</p></li>

<h2>Terraform<a class="headerlink" href="#terraform" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool that allows developers to manage and provision cloud infrastructure in a declarative way. It enables teams to define and automate the deployment and configuration of infrastructure resources, including virtual machines, containers, load balancers, and other cloud services.</p>
</div>
<p>Terraform uses a domain-specific language (DSL) called HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) to define the desired state of infrastructure resources. The HCL code describes the desired configuration of the infrastructure and the dependencies between resources. Terraform then compares the desired state to the current state of the infrastructure and generates a plan for making any necessary changes.</p>
<p>Terraform supports a wide range of cloud providers, including Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and many others. It also supports on-premises infrastructure, such as VMware and OpenStack.</p>
<p>One of the key benefits of using Terraform is that it allows teams to manage infrastructure as code, making it easier to version control, collaborate, and test infrastructure changes. It also enables teams to provision infrastructure quickly and consistently, reducing the risk of configuration drift and human error.</p>
<p>Terraform has become a popular tool for infrastructure automation and is widely used in many organizations, from startups to large enterprises.</p>

<h2>Terraform vs competitors<a class="headerlink" href="#terraform-vs-competitors" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>There are several infrastructure-as-a-code (IaaC) tools that are similar to Terraform and can be considered as competitors. Here are some of the most popular ones:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>CloudFormation</strong>: CloudFormation is an IaC tool provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows developers to define and deploy AWS infrastructure resources using a JSON or YAML file. It is tightly integrated with other AWS services and can be used to provision and manage resources in AWS.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ansible</strong>: Ansible is an open-source automation tool that can be used for infrastructure as code. It uses a YAML-based language to define the desired state of infrastructure and can be used to configure and manage servers, networks, and other infrastructure resources.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Chef</strong>: Chef is an open-source configuration management tool that can be used for infrastructure as code. It uses a Ruby-based language to define infrastructure as code and can be used to manage servers, applications, and other infrastructure resources.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Puppet</strong>: Puppet is an open-source configuration management tool that can be used for infrastructure as code. It uses declarative language to define the desired state of infrastructure and can be used to manage servers, applications, and other infrastructure resources.</p></li>
<li><p>SaltStack: SaltStack is an open-source automation tool that can be used for infrastructure as code. It uses a YAML-based language to define the desired state of infrastructure and can be used to manage servers, networks, and other infrastructure resources.</p></li>

<section id="getting-started">
<h2>Getting started<a class="headerlink" href="#getting-started" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>If you’re new to Terraform and want to get started, here are some steps you can follow:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Choose a Cloud Provider: Terraform supports a wide range of cloud providers, including AWS, Azure, GCP, and many others. Choose a cloud provider that you want to work with and create an account if you don’t have one already.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a Basic Terraform Configuration: Create a basic Terraform configuration file that defines the resources you want to create in your cloud provider.</p></li>
<li><p>Initialize the Terraform Configuration: Once you have created the Terraform configuration file, initialize Terraform by running the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">terraform</span> <span class="pre">init</span></code> command in the directory containing the configuration file. This command will download the necessary provider plugins and set up the Terraform environment.</p></li>
<li><p>Plan the Terraform Configuration. Before you apply the Terraform configuration, you can use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">terraform</span> <span class="pre">plan</span></code> command to see what changes Terraform will make to your infrastructure. This command will generate a plan that shows what resources will be created, updated, or destroyed.</p></li>
<li><p>Apply the Terraform Configuration: Once you have initialized Terraform, you can apply the configuration by running the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">terraform</span> <span class="pre">apply</span></code> command. This command will create the resources defined in the configuration file.</p></li>
<li><p>Manage the Terraform State: Terraform maintains a state file that tracks the current state of your infrastructure. It is important to manage this state file carefully, as it is used to determine what changes need to be made to your infrastructure. You can use Terraform commands like ‘terraform plan’ and ‘terraform destroy’ to manage the state and make changes to your infrastructure.</p></li>
